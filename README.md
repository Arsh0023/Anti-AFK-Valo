# Anti-AFK-Valo
We all hate being AFK in games. But Valorant hates us more for being AFK and also gives us a sweet penalty for doing so. But sometimes we have to leave the game so for that i made this script which does random key presses(w,a,s,d).

Key Points:-
  -Random key presses are made for keys defined in the list `keys`. This can be modified to whatever keys you want to add.
  -time interval can be changed using using `break`.
 
Modifyable Variables:
`_break` - Use this to define the time interval between two key presses.
