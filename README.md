# Anti-AFK-Valo
We all hate being AFK in games. But Valorant hates us more for being AFK and also gives us a sweet penalty for doing so. But sometimes we have to leave the game so for that i made this script which does random key presses(w,a,s,d).

### After returning from afk first close the script using `Ctrl+C` or simply closing the command window and they proceed your playing.

Key Points:-
-------------
  - Random key presses are made for keys defined in the list `keys`. This can be modified to whatever keys you want to add.
  - Time interval can be changed using using `_break`.
 
Modifyable Variables:
---------------------
`_break` - Use this to define the time interval between two key presses.
